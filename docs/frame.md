# The frame: from a rendered image to pixels

The network takes 16 f16 or f32 lanes per padded pixel and returns 4 lanes, stored as f32 by default or f16 with
`Graph::Options::fp16Head`. Everything around that (building the lanes,
turning the head into an image, and the temporal loop) is the *pipeline*, and it is as much a part of matching
NVIDIA's output as the network is. `demo/` implements it; `demo/README.md` covers building and driving the demo,
this file covers what it computes and why.

```
 Filament scene view          -> HDR rgba16f color
 Filament structure pass      -> rgba32ui velocity (object id, depth bits, motion x/y bits)
      |
      v  velocity_unpack.comp
 motion rgba16f (xy: current -> previous, uv units, y down; z: 1 if that previous position
      |          is on screen, i.e. there is a history, else 0)
      v  nr_preprocess.comp
 features f16 [field][16]  ---->  the network (src/)  ---->  head f16 [field][4]
      |                                                          |
      +---------------------------- nr_composite.comp <----------+
                                          |
                          rgba8 output + the next history (rgba16f)
                                          |
                                Filament present view + ImGui
```

The NR work is recorded **into Filament's own command buffer**, between the scene view and the present view,
through a patched `Engine::queueVulkanCommand` hook. No extra submissions, no host synchronization, and the
renderer's own resource tracking stays valid because the pass leaves every image in
`SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`.

The demo stores features as f16, moving the original block-0 conversion to the
preprocess store. It also opts into f16 head storage: the original half
accumulator bits are retained, then expanded to f32 before composition. The
composition arithmetic and history truncation are unchanged; default Graph
callers and CLI head exports remain f32. Composite writes directly
to the renderer's storage-capable RGBA8 target and independently updates history.
Unknown or non-storage target usage retains the copy route. See
[optimization-validation.md](optimization-validation.md) for the integration
contract, allocation measurements and regression checks.

## The proxy

The network does not see HDR. It sees a *display proxy*: paper-white-relative scene radiance with a soft
shoulder above 0.75, sRGB-encoded, on the half grid.

```
v = scene / max(paperWhite, 0.05)
v = v > 0.75 ? 0.75 + 0.25 * (1 - exp(-5.770780 * (v - 0.75))) : v
proxy = f16(srgbEncode(v))                           # 0..1 code value
centred = f16((f16(proxy) - 0.5) * 0.125)            # feature lanes 4-6
```

Lanes 7-9 are the same transform applied to the reprojected previous **output**, not the previous scene. Non-
finite and negative scene values are clamped to zero first; the network's dynamic range is not the renderer's.

## Motion vectors

Filament has no per-object motion vectors, so the patch adds them: the picking/structure pass writes, per pixel,
`(object id, depth bits, motion x, motion y)` where motion is `previous NDC - current NDC`. The engine keeps the
previous world transform per renderable, the previous bones and morph weights for skinned and morphed meshes,
the previous per-instance transforms, and the previous un-jittered clip-from-world per view. Cost: one
depth-only pass.

`velocity_unpack.comp` turns that into motion in uv units with y down, plus **whether there is a history**: a
flag, not a value of the motion. Zero motion means "the history is at this same pixel", which is a claim, so it
cannot also stand for "there is none".

| pixel | motion | history |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a surface whose previous position is on screen | the recorded one | yes |
| a surface whose previous position is off screen (it entered at the edge) | - | **no** |
| nothing drawn, or depth 0 (the skybox: Filament draws it at infinity with a zero motion vector) | the camera's reprojection of a point at infinity | yes, if on screen |

The background's motion comes from the host: previous clip <- current clip through the two views' rotations only
(`previous projection x rotation x inverse(current projection x rotation)`), because a point at infinity does not
see the camera's translation; it is exactly the identity when the camera did not change. On the scripted orbit
(a pure yaw, where every depth moves like infinity) it reproduces the renderer's recorded motion of every drawn
pixel to 1e-6 NDC.

Where there is no history, the preprocess gives lanes 7-9 the current proxy - the input of a first frame - and
the composite blends with weight 0. The previous colour at the same pixel belongs to another surface.

What the flag does **not** cover: a surface uncovered by motion (disocclusion) keeps its valid motion, and its
history sample is whatever was in front of it. An object-id test cannot tell those pixels apart here - coplanar
and overlapping renderables trade places between frames, which makes object id no surface identity, and the
previous depth is not recorded - so that case is left to the network's per-pixel blend logit, as it always was.
How well the network rejects such a history is its own behaviour and is not measured per pixel here; its mean
blend weight on Bistro falls from 0.69 at rest to 0.15 during the scripted orbit.

Blended (translucent) renderables are not in the structure pass, so they carry only the camera's motion;
masked ones carry their own.

Verification (`--frames 220 --capture verify --orbit 0.4`): reprojecting frame 99's color with frame 100's
motion must reproduce frame 100. On Bistro at 1280x720 the mean error is 0.006, against 0.030 with no
reprojection and 0.037 with the sign flipped; with an animated asset and a static camera the skinned/morphed
path gives 0.007 against 0.014. On the Fox's skybox (842,536 pixels at 1280x720) the camera motion at infinity
gives 0.0011 against 0.0045 for the zero motion the skybox is drawn with. With the camera still, the displayed
frame is the same byte for byte with or without the history flag.

## History reconstruction

Both the preprocess (for lanes 7-9) and the composite sample the history at the reprojected position with a
**five-tap Catmull-Rom** filter (the four axis taps plus the centre, with the bilinear-weight trick), clamped to
the valid rectangle. A box or bilinear filter here visibly softens the result frame over frame, because the
history is fed back into the network's input.

## Composition

```
neural  = clamp(proxy + rgb / 4, 0, 1)                         # head channels 0-2, in proxy code space
weight  = clamp(sigmoid(head.a) * blendScale, 0, 1)            # blendScale: a learned f16 in the model
neural  = lerp(neural, history, weight)                        # only where there is a history (not after a
                                                               # reset, not where it came from off screen)
history' = truncate_to_half(neural)                            # stored for the next frame
```

The fourth head channel is the network's own opinion about how much of the history to keep, per pixel;
`blendScale` (`block70.layer0.blend_scale`, 0.7397 in the shipped model) is a global learned cap on it. Note the
publication: the stored history is **truncated** toward zero to the half grid, not rounded. The next frame's
input lanes depend on it, so it is a publication point like any other.

After the blend the demo applies the optional style operator, the intensity blend back towards the proxy, and
then its own display path, which is not part of NR:

* **style**: the `natural` / `cinematic` presets are exposure, contrast and saturation offsets scaled by the
  local tone, applied in the same HSL operator the native runtime uses (the `exp2(log2(x))` round trips in
  `nr_composite.comp` are that operator's gamma = 1 path, kept literally). `custom` exposes its knobs.
* **tone upgrade**: the neural result is LDR; `upgradeToneMap` puts it back on the HDR scene by matching
  luminance ratios and transferring hue in Oklab, so highlights that the proxy clipped are not lost.
* **display transform**: ACES fit + sRGB into rgba8, matching the WebGI viewer this demo mirrors.

With NR off the composite takes the same display path on the scene itself and keeps the history primed with the
proxy, so toggling NR does not produce a one-frame flash.

## Frames in flight

Two history images and two parameter buffers alternate by `frame & 1`. The NR work is **pre-recorded once per
(history parity, NR on/off)** into four secondary command buffers, because nothing in it changes between frames
except the parameter block, which is written into the command stream with `vkCmdUpdateBuffer`. A resize (or the
renderer handing over different images) rebuilds the descriptor sets and those four command buffers while the
renderer is idle; the model, the kernels and the pipelines survive it. The same rebuild, with a barrier after every
launch, is what happens if a chained wait ever gives up (execution.md, the watchdog): that frame is wrong, and the
pass does not chain again.

Timestamps follow the same parity: a frame's six stamps are read two frames later, when the GPU is certainly
done with them, which is why the UI's timings lag by two frames and never stall the queue.

The four secondary command buffers reference **one Graph workspace**, not four
copies of its allocations. Supported `NrPass` routes reuse whole buffers after
their final GPU readers; retained encoder skips and block 0 keep their required
lifetimes. Domain handovers are GPU execution dependencies. Frame entry orders
counter clearing after earlier readers, and the preceding composite must finish
reading the head before the next graph execution reuses its storage.

Two queued frames use fixed external image bindings and execute in order on the
adopted queue. Do not rotate or rebind those images, resize, or destroy the pass
while commands referring to them are pending. Public Graph allocations and the
F16 input remain dedicated. The head's bytes are valid through its current-frame
consumers, not across a subsequent graph execution. Capture and unsupported
kernel routes keep dedicated storage. `NrPass` defaults to workspace reuse;
passing `false` as its last constructor argument selects the diagnostic control.
Other Graph callers must opt in explicitly. See [validation](optimization-validation.md)
for exact temporal/queued-frame checks and measured memory, distinct from timing.

## Resolution

The network runs at the window's resolution, padded to the field. `NrPass::resize` re-fits everything in about
50 ms. There is no upscaling anywhere in the pipeline: DLSS-SR is a different network and is not part of this
repository.
